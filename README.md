Hello, my name is Juliana Baptista! How are you? ;) 

To run this notebook you will need to install the dependencies, particularly I like to use pip install for its simplicity, 
see how here (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) :
- Pandas **
- pymongo **
- dns **
- hashlib **
- matplot *
- seaborn *
**These modules are necessary to see the output data if you choose to run the code on your notebook.
*These modules are only for the visualization of a graph.

Run the project;
To run this project you can download the code and paste it on a jupyter notebook. Jupyter can be downloaded and installed by anaconda (my choice) or used directly on a browser. 
See how here: (https://jupyter.org/try)

See the output data;
After you have a way to run the code through jupyter, you can simply click the run button and the results with the output data will be show to you. It was requested that the code should allow further executions. If there is a new file with the same number of columns, it can be simply updated on mongodb database, I use mongo compass to do that. The quality of the data is secure, although if there is a change on the number of the columns the code may need alterations. The amount of data from the rows will only affect the variable 'tamanho' that is the lenght of the loaded data (maximum indices).

If you have no python installed and wish to use anaconda this tutorial is the way: https://paulovasconcellos.com.br/como-baixar-anaconda-31fd49c19bd8
